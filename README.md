Steps to solve the problems

Here's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English. Algorithm
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

Q.1
We need to write a program to find the position of a given number in a list of numbers arranged in decreasing order. We also need to minimize the number of times we access elements from the list.

\*\*\* Tip
use descriptive names for functions and variables
Think about all the possible scenarios
